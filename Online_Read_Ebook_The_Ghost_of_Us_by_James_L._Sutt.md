Overview
&quot;I was in a slump where I hated everything I read, and The Ghost of Us lifted me right out of it. Absolutely fantastic.&quot; â€”Dan Wells, bestselling author of I Am Not a Serial Killer
 
 One Last Stop meets Cemetery Boys in this swoony YA romance from beloved author James L. Sutter.
 
 Eighteen-year-old ghost hunter Cara is determined to escape life as a high school outcast by finding proof of the supernatural. Yet when she stumbles upon the spirit of Aiden, a popular upperclassman who died the previous year, she learns that ghosts have goals of their own. In the wake of his death, Aidenâ€™s little sister, Meredith, has become a depressed recluse, and Aiden canâ€™t pass on into the afterlife until he knows sheâ€™ll be okay. Believing that nothing pulls someone out of a slump like romance, he makes Cara a deal: seduce Meredith out of her shell and take her to prom, and Aiden will give Cara all the evidence she needs for fame. If not, wellâ€”no dates, no ghost.
 
 Wooing the standoffish Meredith isnâ€™t going to be easy, however. With Aidenâ€™s coaching, Cara slowly manages to win Meredith overâ€”but finds herself accidentally falling for her in the process. Worse yet: as Meredith gets happier and Aidenâ€™s mission nears completion, his ghost begins to fade. Can Cara continue to date Meredith under false pretenses, especially if it means Aiden will vanish forever? Or should she tell Meredith the truth, and risk both of them hating her? And either way, will she lose her only shot at proving ghosts are real?
