Overview
This B&amp;N exclusive edition features an alternative cover, designed endpapers, and a unique case and case stamp. Welcome, welcome back to the mysteriously enchanting world of CARAVAL! Return to the legendary magic and the whimsical wonder with this beautifully illustrated holiday novella.
 
 Snowflakes are falling.
 Invitations are arriving.
 And holiday magic is swirling in the capital city of the Meridian Empire.
 
 Itâ€™s Great Holiday Eve Eve. Scarlett Dragna is planning a spectacular Holiday celebration for the city. Donatella is searching for the perfect gift. Julian is looking ridiculously handsome in green. And Legend . . .
 
 Well, sadly Legend is not fond of the Great Holiday. Tella is hoping her perfect gift will change his mind. Unfortunately, she hasnâ€™t found this perfect gift just yet. But it is Great Holiday Eve Eve . . . surely thereâ€™s some holiday magic swirling around.
 
 Welcome, welcome back to the world of Caraval, where even holidays are not as they seem.
 
 Set after Stephanie Garber&#039;s #1 NEW YORK TIMES bestselling Caraval series, this delightful novella will take readers on the ultimate holiday adventure full of clockwork boys, poisoned candy, impish snow globes, merriment, andâ€”if Tella gets her wayâ€”love.
 
 Gorgeously illustrated by Rosie Thorns, SPECTACULAR is the perfect edition for collectors, readers, dreamers, and lovers of holiday magic.
