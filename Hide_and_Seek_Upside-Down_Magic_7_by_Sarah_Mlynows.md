The Upside-Down Magic kids are back in another topsy-turvy adventure in the next installment of this New York Times bestselling series, now a Disney Channel Original Movie!

 When Nory&amp;#039;s magic first appeared, her father wanted her to go to fancy, selective Sage Academy, where he is the headmaster. But Nory&amp;#039;s magic went upside-down at the worst possible moment . . . and she was sent to Dunwiddle Middle School instead!

 The good news? Nory loves Dunwiddle, and her best friends have upside-down magic, too!

 The bad news? When a flood wrecks Dun­widdle, Nory and her UDM friends are forced to relocate . . . to Sage Academy!

 Sure, there&amp;#039;s a magical skunk garden, a school-wide Hide and Seek night, and expensive gloves that help Nory&amp;#039;s friend Elliott with his flaring, but Nory&amp;#039;s father and the rest of the teachers are super strict, and Nory doesn&amp;#039;t feel like she fits in . . . at all. When she&amp;#039;s offered the chance to stay at Sage for good, she has to decide where she belongs . . . and if Sage Academy can learn that magic comes in all shapes and sizes.
