Overview
From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Mia Sheridan comes her next novel in the Pelion Lake series. How is it possible that perfect Gage Buchanan is still single after all these years? He can&#039;t quite figure it out himself. Perhaps he hasn&#039;t met the right woman. Maybe he&#039;s spent too many years focusing on workâ€”or maybe he just isn&#039;t as perfect as everyone thinks he is. Gage thought he left his days of one-night stands behind him, however something about the gorgeous cocktail waitress in a town three hours away is far too intriguing. But when she shows up weeks later in his hometown, Calliope, pretending to be an art appraiser, Gage is completely blindsidedâ€”not to mention still very attracted to the (apparent) little liar. He can&#039;t figure her out: not her angle nor the persistent pull between them. Aurora &quot;Rory&quot; Casteel is determined to find her father. All she knows from her late mother is that he lives in Calliope and he&#039;s an important part of the town. So when Rory&#039;s gallery-owning friend offers to run cover for her while she sleuths around town, she jumps at the chance. But she doesn&#039;t anticipate the man she spent one wild night with turning out to be a local. Sure, it puts a wrinkle in Rory&#039;s plan, but she can work around Gage Buchanan. Even as it gets harder to pretend her heart doesn&#039;t flip every time he&#039;s in the room. She has a suspicion he isn&#039;t everything he seems, either, but maybe it&#039;s &quot;perfect&quot; Gage&#039;s flaws that are what she&#039;s really drawn to.
