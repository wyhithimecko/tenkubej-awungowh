Overview
I&#039;m Unvaccinated and That&#039;s OK!Â is the story of an unvaccinated child named Nicholas Novaks, who shares the many reasons why his parents have chosen not to vaccinate him. Nicholas explains his parentsâ€™ personal concerns about vaccine injury, the importance of finding a doctor they can trust and openly speak with, the research they did before making this decision, and what life is like for an unvaccinated child who has an older, vaccine-injured sibling. Â 

 Inspired by the personal stories of vaccine-injured children, which have been shared with Dr. Shannon Kroner over many years of working with special needs families, Dr. Kroner aims to raise awareness of the importance of vaccine choice and the necessity of doing the research before making an important decision such as vaccination.Â 

 Join Nicholas as he shares what it means to be an unvaccinated child in todayâ€™s world and why one&#039;s personal choice regarding vaccination must always be respected.

Iâ€™m Unvaccinated and Thatâ€™s OK! is published through ICAN PRESS, an imprint of Skyhorse Publishing.
