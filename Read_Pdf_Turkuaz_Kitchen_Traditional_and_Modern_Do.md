Notes From Your Bookseller Every bake has to start somewhere, and Bet√ºl Tun√ß is here to guide you through the ins and outs of crafting the exact dough needed for the best possible flavor. In her first cookbook, social media star and baker Bet√ºl Tun√ß of Turkuaz Kitchen shares 85 recipes for sweet and savory doughs and the dishes to make with them.
 
 Bet√ºl Tun√ß&amp;#039;s love affair with dough began when she was just eight years old in Erzurum, a city nestled in northeastern Turkey known for its long and snowy winters. During the dark, frosty days, she found solace baking Turkish breads and desserts with her mother and sisters.
 
 Bet√ºl&amp;#039;s enthusiasm for baking, especially for creating sweet and savory doughs from scratch, followed her through her eventual move to the U.S. and the expansion of her family. While searching for a creative outlet to share her cooking in her new home, Bet√ºl began creating vintage-style videos on Instagram, garnering an audience that grew rapidly with each personal post she shared.
 
 In Turkuaz Kitchen, her first cookbook, Bet√ºl shares eighty-five recipes for sweet and savory doughs and the dishes to make with them. With inspiration from traditional Turkish recipes, as well as recipes she discovered in her travels, Turkuaz Kitchen is a treasure trove of recipes for:
 
 Basic Doughs: such as bagels, pita, ciabatta, and pizza dough Enriched Doughs: such as croissants, cardamom buns, buttermilk dinner rolls, and burger buns Quick Breads and Short Doughs: such as pie and tart dough, scones, biscuits, and biscotti Unleavened Doughs: such as pastas, noodles, and dumplings Doughs from Turkey: such as Turkish style phyllo, Turkish Pistachio Baklava, Spinach Triangle Borek, and Grandma&amp;#039;s Lavash 
 Cooking for loved ones has always been one of Bet√ºl&amp;#039;s greatest joys. With warm, achievable, and inspiring recipes for cooks of all skill levels, Turkuaz Kitchen invites readers into the kitchen to create their own food memories with those they cherish most.
