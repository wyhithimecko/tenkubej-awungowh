Overview
When Alina is assigned to oversee a battle tournament held once every four years, she knows she&#039;s in for one hell of a workload. Good thing Iffole Counter is holding the grand prize, a rare and valuable statue which is, crucially, unbreakableâ€”itâ€™s the perfect thing to take out her frustrations on. That is, until she smacks it too hard, and its head pops right off! Will she have to pay for it? And worse, what if someone finds out a mere receptionist broke the unbreakable? Alinaâ€™s only choice is to glue the thing back together, win the tournament, and take home the prize herself!
